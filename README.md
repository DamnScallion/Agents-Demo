# üß† Agents-Demo

A curated collection of interactive notebooks demonstrating modern LLM **agent frameworks** in action. Each notebook highlights a unique approach to building intelligent agents that can reason, use tools, or collaborate.

## üìÅ Notebooks Overview

| Notebook | Framework | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `Agent Demo 1 - Agent - AutoGen - Demo.ipynb` | **LangChain (AgentExecutor)** | A foundational agent example using LangChain's `AgentExecutor` with OpenAI tools and ReAct-style reasoning. |
| `Agent Demo 2 - Open-AI-Agent.ipynb` | **OpenAI Function Calling** | Demonstrates structured tool-use with OpenAI‚Äôs function-calling interface and custom tool definitions. |
| `Agent Demo 3 - LangChain Agent.ipynb` | **LangChain Agent** | Builds a more advanced LangChain agent capable of tool selection, memory use, and intermediate reasoning steps. |
| `Agent Demo 4 - LangGraph - multi-agent-collaboration.ipynb` | **LangGraph (Multi-Agent)** | Simulates a collaborative multi-agent system using LangGraph to coordinate multiple agents in a directed graph. |
